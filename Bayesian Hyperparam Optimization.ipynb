    "Due to the sensitivity of the cLSTM's hyperparameters, we use Bayesian optimization to discover a high-performing set of training and regularization hyperparameter values. Bayesian optimization is a natural framework for hyperparameter search. It excels at optimization under uncertainty, particularly with noisy black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate, such as training and evaluating neural networks.\n",

    "Now, let's define the score model $\\sigma$. The score function is tricky in this context because we do not actually have a concrete way of quantifying how well a model is doing. Since we're interested in the Granger Causality coefficients and not the overall predictive power, just using the MSE loss would not give us the results we want. However, we can encode the belief that we expect there to be some causal links between bacteria. We also believe that causal links should generally be more prevalant along the diagonal. This led us to develop the following score function:\n",

    "\n",
    "This function is imprecise, but allows us to run optimization in order to find models that provide interesting results. In practice, non-lienar models are extremely difficult to train and most get all non-zero or all zero GC values. Thus, any model that gets a non-zero score with the above function is potentially of value to us. Whether or not it is precisely calibrated, it is useful in helping us discover hyperparameter confugirations that are useful to us."
